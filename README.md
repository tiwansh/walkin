#Walkin

An iOS application with user authentication(registration and login) that connects to a Bluetooth beacon device and automatically logs in the entries and exits of the user without any human intervention. To log in and out, the user must enter and exit the predefined Bluetooth beacon range. The application uses Google's Firebase mobile platform for the cloud back-end and provides a real-time synchronized application with no local storages.
